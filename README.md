# Python OOPs Tutorial 🚀

Welcome to the **Python OOPs Tutorial** repository! This is a **comprehensive, step-by-step guide** to mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** in Python. Whether you are a beginner or an intermediate Python developer, this tutorial will help you understand classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction with practical examples.

---

## 🔹 Repository Overview

Python OOPs allows you to represent **real-world entities as objects**. Using OOPs, you can organize your code in a **modular, reusable, and maintainable way**. This repository covers all the fundamental concepts of Python OOPs with clear examples and exercises.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- Classes & Objects
- Attributes & Methods
- Constructor (`__init__`)
- Inheritance (single, multi-level, hierarchical)
- Encapsulation (private & protected attributes, getters/setters)
- Polymorphism (method overriding, operator overloading)
- Abstraction (abstract classes and methods)

## 🔹 Why Learn Python OOPs?

- **Code Reusability:** Avoid duplication by using classes and inheritance.  
- **Modularity:** Organize your code into logical, reusable units.  
- **Abstraction:** Hide complex implementation details and show only essential functionality.  
- **Encapsulation:** Secure data and control access with private/protected attributes.  
- **Polymorphism:** Flexibly handle multiple object types using the same interface.
